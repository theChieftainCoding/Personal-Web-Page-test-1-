	<h3> Where do I want to go? </h3>
<font color="#222222">
	<p> As of right now, I'm looking to get an NROTC(Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps) Scholarship 	which 		would make money no issue. Assuming I get the scholarship, I would most likely go to The 	Citadel. It's a military 		college in Charleston, South Carolina with tons of cool history. However, if I do not 	get the NROTC scholarship, I 		would likely go to a Florida university, mostly because I would likely qualify for a BrightFutures scholarship for 100% 		tution if NROTC doesn't work out. </p>
<br>
<br>

<font color="#A6192E">
	<h3> What do I want to major in? </h3>
<font color="#222222">
	<p> If I receive an NROTC scholarship and go to The Citadel, I will be majoring in Cyber Operations. It is a cross 		between cybersecurity and computer science. It's essentially Information Warfare which is keeping your data safe 			while trying to get into other people's data. </p>
	<br>
	<p> If I don't get the NROTC scholarship, then I would probably major in Cyber Forensics, Cybersecurity, or 		Computer Science depending on where I go. </p>
<br>
<br>

<font color="#A6192E">
	<h3> What do I want to be when I grow up? </h3>
<font color="#222222">
	<p> My first choice will always be, a <strong> <em> <u> Marine </u> </em> </strong> . I can tell you one thing for 	sure though, I'm gonna be in the Military at some point in my life. It's how I grew up and it's how I want to live. 	Marine is just a title though, so I've got to narrow it down just a little more to actually answer the question. The 	thing is though, it's not really up to me. If I do NROTC with a Marine Option contract, then I would do Officer 	Candidate School(OCS) and The Basic School(TBS). Based on my performance at those schools and college, then I 	would get selected to go into an area. If I don't do NROTC, I would most likely enlist, do some time, and then 	commission under the Enlisted Commissioning Program(ECP). <br> <b> TLDR: </b> I want to be a Marine, my exact 	job isn't really up to me. </p>

<font color="#222222">
	<b> <u> Cox Telecommunications </u> </b>
<br>
	<p> Esentially, Telecommunications deals with Internet, Cable, and data. It is the industry all about moving data 	around in different ways. We're sponsored by Cox so we follow their cirriculum for what they would expect from a 	Technician being trained. During Junior year, we will begin applying for <b> Paid </b> interships at Cox, AT&T, the 	School District, and other companies in the Telecommunications field. During Senior year, we begin working at those 	companies under the interships we applied for during Junior year. We also take the Society of Cable 	Telecommunications Engineers(SCTE) certificaiton exam which is esentially the national certificaiton that most, if not 	all technicians take. </p>
