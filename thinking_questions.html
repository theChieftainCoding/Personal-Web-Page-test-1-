<h3> If a book could be created about you, what would the title of that book be? </h3>
<font color="#222222">
<p> The title of the book would probably be something along the lines of  "<i><b>I did it my way</b></i>" </p>

<font color="#A6192E">
<h3> If you could be on any reality or game show, what would it be and why? </h3>
<font color="#222222">
<p> I would have to say America Says. It's a gameshow similar to the Price is Right, except you have to guess how Americans answered the question. I say America says because I will get lots of videos like that about people answering questions(typically trivia as part of a game) and it's really interesting to me. I don't really know why. I think it would also just be interesting to hear what people come up with. </p>

<font color="#A6192E">
<h3> You have been given a plane ticket to anywhere in the world.  Where would you go? Why? </h3>
<font color="#222222">
</p> I would probably say <i><b>Paris, France</b></i>. <em><b>Not necesarrily for the reason you think</b></em>, though. First off, Paris is a nice city, when the workers aren't on strike and Macron is being a good boy. Good food and such. However, it also has one of the better rail networks and road systems in Europe. Therefore, I could get to Europe, Africa(if I really tried) and Asia without another plane ticket. So it's just the good decision to get around with only one plane ticket. </p>

<h3> If you were stranded on a deserted island, what is the one luxury item you would wish to have? Why? </h3>
<font color="#222222">
<p> I would want to have <i><b>a cigar lighter</b></i>. The reason is that they burn super hot so I can get fires started quickly. They are also pretty portable compared to something like a blowtorch. 
<br> (I've got a picture of one below.) </p>
